## Ed Kerry

Previously a project manager and fundraiser, I have embraced a long-term desire to become a web developer. I am adept at evaluating large-scale problems, researching options, and implementing incremental steps to reach final solutions.

I have helped over 600 vulnerable people learn life-saving skills, raised over Â£750,000 to transform the lives of people with learning disabilities, and delivered IT Security reports to cabinet ministers. These were not all the same job.

Now I am seeking my first role in an exciting new career. I want to be challenged by and learn from supportive, collaborative teammates in a friendly, creative and adventurous organisation.

## Skills

#### Detail-oriented Problem Solving

I greatly enjoy exploring potential solutions to problems, discovering the simplest and most effective methods. New problems are not daunting, but an opportunity to learn and achieve more!

- I am a logical, calm thinker. When multiple, potentially interesting, options are available I am able to assess their suitability of solving the initial problem. This lets me choose the best tools for the job.
- I am persistent when facing adversity. Charitable and governmental project planning naturally involves limited resources, set-backs and uncertainty. I have found this mind-set very applicable to code.
- When facing a new problem, my first step is to research. In the past this has involved reading research papers or running focus groups. Recently I have become proficient with Googling specific technical issues.
- Solving a problem, especially if I am able to help someone else on the way, can be even more satisfying than everything working right first time!

#### Clear, clean code written the right way

Makers Academy has taught me the very best practices in modern software development.

- Coding is not a solitary activity for me, but a team effort. I am a great fan of pair programming, and at Makers Academy I paired every day. This was a great opportunity for shared learning and teamwork.
- I am very excited to extend my knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming, creating new systems using Behavior Driven Development, Test Driven Development and SOLID principles.
- At Makers, development is seen as a true craft. Making it work is just the first step, and I am committed to refactoring to allow other developers understand and extend my code without resorting to modification.
- Most crucially, I have a great curiosity and passion for code. I enjoy independent and exploratory learning, experimenting with new ideas so I can expand my skills.

#### Project planning

With over five years experience of project management, I am able to keep in mind the many small tasks that amount to a final product. Projects have included innovative first-aid training, launching a cafe run by and for adults with learning disabilities, and penetration-testing of websites.

- At the British Red Cross I led on the research and development of a PRINCE2 project. This project was nominated for a national Excellence award, and used as a model of best practice throughout the organisation.
- Working for a New Zealand government department, I co-ordinated a major Waterfall-driven ICT security project, and multiple smaller agile IT projects. These projects involved multiple stakeholders, including other government departments, the cabinet office and external contractors. I took part in regular Scrums with security consultants.
- The majority of these projects ran to deadlines and budget. However, I have often drafted escalation papers to explain deviations from expectations, and developed pivot-plans when necessary to keep things on track.
- Makers Academy operates as a modern software house, running an agile approach with design-sprints, twice-daily stand-ups and iterative production.
